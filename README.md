Based on [Bolt CMS](http://bolt.cm)

Bolt is a tool for Content Management, which strives to be as simple and straightforward 
as possible. It is quick to set up, easy to configure, uses elegant templates, and above 
all: It's a joy to use. Bolt is created using modern open source libraries, and is best 
suited to build sites in HTML5 with modern markup. 

From a technical perspective: Bolt is written in PHP, and uses either SQLite, MySQL or 
PostgreSQL as a database. It's built upon the [Silex framework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) 
together with a number of [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) [components](http://symfony.com/components) 
and [other libraries](http://docs.bolt.cm/credits). Bolt is released under the open source 
[MIT-license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
